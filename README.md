1. Review the existing code
2. Identify potential improvements
3. Implement your suggested improvements

### Key Areas to Consider
- Performance optimization
- Error handling
- State management
- Code organization
- TypeScript usage

## Getting Started

The workspace will automatically start both frontend and backend services.
- Frontend: http://localhost:4200
- Backend: http://localhost:3000

## API Endpoints

- GET /api/pois - Get all POIs
- GET /api/pois/search?q=term - Search POIs
- GET /api/pois/category/:category - Get POIs by category
- GET /api/pois/:id - Get POI by ID
